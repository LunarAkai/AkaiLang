# Akai Lang

Akai Lang (yeah I'm not creative and the name is still unused on github, sooo) is a programming language I'm building as a side project to my Moonhare Game Engine.

**Work in Progress - doesn't work yet**

## Planned Features
- Object-Oriented
- dynamic typing
- LLVM Backend

## Hello World
```AkaiLang
fun helloWorld() {
    print("Hello World!")
}
```
